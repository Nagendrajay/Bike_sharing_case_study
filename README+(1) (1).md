## General Information
- PA bike-sharing system is a service in which bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or free. Many bike share systems allow people to borrow a bike from a "dock" which is usually computer-controlled wherein the user enters the payment information, and the system unlocks it. This bike can then be returned to another dock belonging to the same system.A US bike sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario. So, it has decided to come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes to an end, and the economy restores to a healthy state. They have contracted a consulting company to understand the factors on which the demand for these shared bikes depends. Specifically, they want to understand the factors affecting the demand for these shared bikes in the American market. The company wants to know:

a) Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes. b) How well those variables describe the bike demands

## Conclusions
1) year -2019-(Positive Correlation)
2) temp (positive correlation)
3) weathersit(negative Correlation)
4) Column Temp and atemp have highest correlation each other.
*they have positive correlation with demand(cnt)

## Technologies Used
Using Python programming in Jupyter notebook following steps has been adopted

library - pandas
library -numpy
library - sklearn
Using Python programming in Jupyter notebook following steps has been adopted

•Data preproceesing •Data cleaning •By building linear Regression model by considering all features ,we try to estimate mean square error-( one and above) •R2 values are reduced from each iteration ( by observing high VIF and low P value) •Linearity, mean of residual Analysis etc. •Validated by Scatter plot – Actual v/s Predicted
<!-- As the libraries versions keep on changing, it is recommended to mention the version of library used in this project -->
